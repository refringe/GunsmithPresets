This is a mod for Single Player Tarkov.  
https://www.sp-tarkov.com

This mod will add weapon presets for each of the guns needed to complete Mechanic's Gunsmith tasks. This mod requires you to unlock the weapon bench, identify the weapon parts, and be able to afford the parts. It's goal is to provide you the builds, but not the means to obtain them. In other words, keep the quest line fun, just remove the annoyance of having to look up which parts to use on the wiki.

To install:

1. Uncompress the contents of the download into the `./user/mods/` directory.  
2. Open the `GunsmithPresets/config/config.json` file to adjust options.
3. Leave a review and let me know what you think.

If you experience any problems, please [submit a detailed bug report](https://github.com/refringe/GunsmithPresets/issues).

Enjoy.
